# postgraduate-D72
It's Friday at last. I really feel like a year goes by. Now I can understand a little bit of business code, but I can't make a qualitative leap until I learn springboot. I'm still at the beginning stage. I really don't know what people who transfer to the profession of programmer through cross examination or even cross industry think. I'm really convinced, Programmers are really the most voluminous and rare profession in the world. Today, the project team was going to have a party together, but I don't want to go. It's not a group at all. I don't feel that everyone is a group at all. It's like no one knows anyone. Everyone doesn't talk. I don't know what these people think.
